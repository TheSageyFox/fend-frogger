FEND Frogger - A Udacity Project by the Front-End Fox

Welcome to my version of popular Atari game Frogger. As a child of the 80s, this was one of my favorite games to enjoy growing up and recreating it for a FEND project was both challenging and rewarding. 

To Start the game:

To start the game, just load it in your web browser. The game automatically starts upon loading. 

Upon winning (reaching the water) an alert pops up to notify the player of their win and automatically resets the game so that the player can enjoy maneuvering the little bug person around the game board until they're choose to stop and close the browser. 

Plans for the Future:
A TODO list, if you will of projected features to be added to the game:

1. Mobile functionality. Currently the game cannot be played on a mobile device for lack of a keyboard. Future implementation of a directional pad below the running game is planned. This will be done by altering the HTML code to include a series of four buttons(left, right, down, up) with event listeners tied to each button to correspond with player movement. 

2. Multi-player. Keyboard space may make multi-player a little tighter, but implementation of a second player using AWSD for directional keys will allow the players to race to the other side together. 

3. Character selection. Optional character selection upon game init. 

4. Score system. System will keep track of wins (player reaches the water) and loses (gets hit by a bug).
